# Blocking notification servers

## 1. Blocking 3rd-party content

Handling any 3rd-party servers on a website is a privacy concern. Based on blocking other 3rd-party content in both Disconnect List and Easylist/Easyprivcy, notifications servers should be treated no differently to other trackers.
Can be also a security issue, a notification server could be used to plant malicious JavaScript without the end user aware of it.

## 2. Annoyance factor.

Notification reminders can disrupt the user with notification spam. The end user visits the web page not for the notifications but for the actual webpage content.
